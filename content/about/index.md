## Sponsors
The sensorgnome project thanks [Phil Taylor's lab at Acadia University](http://discovery.acadiau.ca) for hosting and supporting the sensorgnome project from 2012 to 2018.

We also thank [Compudata.ca](https://compudata.ca) for contributing the hosting for this site, and for donating a portion of each unit sold to help us support and develop the platform.  Compudata manfacturers and sells sensorgnomes with full warranty support.  Although sensorgnome.org is an independent, open source project that provides users with the ability to build their own sensorgnome, we suggest that most users will save on total ownership cost (as well as frustration) by ordering sensorgnomes from Compudata.
