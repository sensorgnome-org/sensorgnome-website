# Sensorgnome Beta Website

This is the beta website for Sensorgnome. Software here is under testing and is not considered stable. If you want current stable Sensorgnome software, go to https://sensorgnome.org.

## What's this

The sensorgnome project has moved to this new site, with hosting kindly donated by [COMPUDATA.ca](https://compudata.ca),
from whom you can purchase pre-built, tested, and eletrically-certified sensorgnomes with warranty support.

## Support

Most support for sensorgnomes happens through the [sensorgnomads google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sensorgnomads).
